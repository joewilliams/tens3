tens3 : simple s3 backup scripts

* uses s3 to backup a directory of files
* uses fadvise to be easy on filesystem caches
* purges files after X days


configuration:

tens3.conf:

amazon_access_key_id: "someid"
amazon_secret_access_key: "somekey"
backup_dir: "/some/path/"
purge_threshold: 3
bucket_name: "somebucket"


usage:

backup a directory of files:

$ ./tens3_put tens3.conf

restore a file from a backup:

$ ./tens3_get tens3.conf date somefile ./somefile

The date is the date that the file was backed up in a YYYYMMDD format.


caveats:

The script will only backup files at one directory level, it does not recurse into subdirectories.
